\subsection{Gamma Decay and Gamma radiation}
Nuclei in excited states can spontaneously transition to lower energy states by emitting a photon (spontaneous emission) or by transferring their energy directly to a shell electron (inner conversion). The Inverse is also possible: if a nucleus is hit by photon that carries the amount energy of a nuclear transition it can be absorbed. The nucleus enters the excited state.
