\section{Summary}
\subsection{Calibration}

\subsection{Background}
By measuring the absorption for different thicknesses of aluminum, the background count rate was determined to be:
\begin{equation*}
A_C= (29.74\pm0.17)s^-1
\end{equation*}	
\subsection{Attenuation by the acrylic glass}

\subsection{One line absorber}

\subsection{Six line absorber}
