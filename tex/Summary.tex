\section{Summary}
\subsection{Background}
By measuring the absorption for different thicknesses of aluminum, the background count rate was determined to be:
\begin{equation*}
A_C= (29.74\pm0.17)s^-1
\end{equation*}	
\subsection{Attenuation by the acrylic glass}
The attenuation coefficient for the acrylic glass was measured, with the result:
\begin{equation*}
\mu_{acr}=\unit{(1.21\pm0.02)}{1/cm}
\end{equation*}
The value contradicts the calculated one $\mu=\unit{1.31019}{1/cm}$. For the later nominal values for $E_\gamma$=\unit{15}{keV} were used which is slightly higher then the energy of the iron transition. Their difference can be explained by different thicknesses of the glass for the absorber and the empty acrylic glass plate. A $5\%$ disagreement would suffice.
\subsection{Single line absorber}
The isomeric shift was measured
\begin{equation*}
E_{iso}= \unit{8.61\pm0.24\cdot10^{-9}}{eV}
\end{equation*}. 
With the calculated effective absorber thickness $T_A=(6.2\pm0.4)$ the Debye-Waller factor of the source was determined:
\begin{equation*}
f_s=0.51\pm0.08
\end{equation*}
The mean life as determined from the Voigt fit is:
\begin{equation*}
\scalebox{1.5}{$\tau$}=\unit{(195\pm140)}{ns}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Six line absorber}
By fitting the sum of six Lorentz curves to the recorded spectrum of natural iron, the following values were determined during evaluation.
\begin{table}[H]\centering
	\begin{tabular}{@{}llllll@{}}
		\toprule
		 Quantity& Value \\

		$\overline{E_{iso}}$ & \unit{(4.9\pm1.1)}{neV}\\

\end{table}
The isomeric shift lies within one standard deviation at the literature $E^{lit}_{iso}=\unit{5.3}{neV}$ value. The measured values for the magnetic moment enclose the literature  value $\mu_e (-0.1549\pm0.002)$\cite{stone} within their 3$\sigma$ intervals.
