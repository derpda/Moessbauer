\section*{Abstract}
In the experiment the absorption spectrum of stainless steel and natural iron are recored by using the MÃ¶ssbauer effect. The Gamma radiation of a Fe-57 decay is Doppler shifted by moving the absorber relative to the source. This allows for a high relative resolution, enabling the measurement of the isometric shift in stainless steel $E_{iso}= \unit{8.61\pm0.24\cdot10^{-9}}{eV}$ and natural iron $\overline{E_{iso}} = \unit{(4.9\pm1.1)}{neV}$. Furthermore the Debye-Waller factor was calculated to be $f_s=0.51\pm0.08$.
